C Airways is a flight ticket reservation system. 
You can add new passengers by class - Tourist, Business or an Employee Ticket.

Tourist class:
A tourist class ticket doesnt have the option to select seat unless you check the ׳Seat׳ option (additional price).

Business class:
A business class ticket automatically has the seat-select option, in addition you can choose meal for a Business class passenger.
There is a show-menu option when you select a Business passenger (it checks the flight departure hour - if its between 1 to 9 a.m it's a breakfast menu, 
otherwise its a lunch/dinner menu).

Employee ticket:
There are two options for an Employee passenger:
1. Stand by
The standby ticket is free, but there is no guarantee that there will be free seats on the flight.
This ticket doesnt reserve a seat for the passenger, the passenger will get on the flight only if there will be a free seat.

2. Regular employee discount
A rugular tourist ticket, has 50% discount and automatically has a seat-choose option.



At the main menu you can see the flight list, the plane map, convert money (from Dollars) to Pound, Euro or Shekels.
Also there is a serialization option - you can save all passengers or by class.
